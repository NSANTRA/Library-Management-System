<!-- **NOTE: The basic structure of the LMS Project is completed but I am still implementing some other features/functions that can make it look a little more presentable. The script.bat file does not concern with the LMS.py and the README.txt files. The .py file purely runs on the CLI (Command-Line Interface) i.e. no GUI (Graphical User Interface). The credentials for the "Admin Login" are:
Username: admin
Password: admin
