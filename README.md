# Library Management System (LMS)

The basic structure of the LMS Project is completed but I am still implementing more functionalities that can make it look a little more user-friendly. The **lms.py** file purely runs on the CLI (Command-Line Interface) i.e. no GUI (Graphical User Interface). The credentials for the **Admin Login** are:
**Username: admin**
**Password: admin**

### Note: 

## Prerequisites

Before running the LMS, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.x** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **MySQL Server** - [Download MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
3. The following Python libraries:
   - `mysql-connector-python`
   - `pandas`
   - `sqlalchemy`
   - `urllib.parse`

   You can install these libraries using `pip`:

   ```sh
   pip install mysql-connector-python pandas sqlalchemy
